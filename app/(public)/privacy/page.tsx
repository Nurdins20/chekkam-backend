          <p className="mt-2 text-chekkam-muted">
            Chekkam (&quot;check am&quot;) lets citizens check suspicious messages and verify official
            documents, and lets institutions cryptographically sign documents. It is built for a
            Cameroon audience and is currently a pre-launch prototype, not a commercially
            released product.

            <li>
              Content you submit to be checked (text, links, or files) — used only to produce a
              risk result and, where you report it, to help identify scam campaigns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Documents submitted for verification — we store a cryptographic hash and signature,
              not the original file, unless you are an institution officer signing a document on
              an institution&apos;s behalf.
            </li>
            <li>
              Account information for staff/institution accounts (email, role) via Supabase Auth.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you contact Chekkam via Telegram or WhatsApp, your chat identifier is stored only
              as a salted hash, never in raw form.

          </h2>
          <p className="mt-2 text-chekkam-muted">
            When configured, submitted message content may be sent to OpenAI for automated risk
            analysis. If that service is unavailable, a local, deterministic rule-based check runs
            instead — no message content leaves our servers in that case. Every automated result
            is advisory only: a human reviews reports before anything is published publicly.

            Reporter identities, raw phone numbers or chat handles, precise locations, and
            evidence files are never included in public alerts. Published alerts use cautious,
            non-accusatory language and never name a private individual without verified, legally
            appropriate evidence.

            A specific retention and deletion schedule has not yet been finalized by the project
